# Discord Players FiveM

Small nodeJS script allowing to change the name of a channel with the number of current players playing on your server!

You just have to configure a bot:

2. Enter the bot token in the script

3. Enter the FiveM detail url of your ex server (https://servers.fivem.net/servers/detail/id)

4. Enter the identifier of the channel where you want the number of players to appear (if you do not know how to copy the identifier, you must put yourself in developer mode on discord and right click on the channel then copy the identifier )
